### Some Standard configs for testing
These configs are used for testing the model for a variety of constraints and preferences. 

#### File Structure

- config_standard.json: Standard config with standard weight and nutritional constraints
- Constraints: A set of 5 files, one for each of the 4 nutrients and 1 for the weight. Each file in this folder has one of that constraint relatively larger than a standard configuration. 
- Preferences: A set of 10 files, each with some combination of positive and negative preferences
